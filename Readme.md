### Installation:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python -m textblob.download_corpora`
3. `python -m spacy download en_core_sci_lg`

### Notes:
- I chose to use a tweet dataset found on github instead of using the Twitter API to gather the tweets. I figured it would be the easiest way to present this project without having to setup a twitter dev account and hide my API credentials.
